h1. GraphBuilder

A simple c# graph library with a fluent interface for graph construction and a
minumum of syntactic noise.

It is not industrial strength, the main emphasis is on prototyping and testing 
graph algorithms. Graphs can be built quickly and individual nodes can contain

h3. Simple Cyclic Graph

          [x]
          / \
       [y]   [w]
          \ /
          [a]
         /   \
       [b]    [d]
        |      | \
       [c]    [e] [f]
              
<pre><code>
    var g1 = Graph.Node("a",
               Graph.Node("b",
                 Graph.Node("c")),
               Graph.Node("d", 
                 Graph.Node("e"),
                 Graph.Node("f")));

    var g2 = Graph.Node("x",
               Graph.Node("y",
                 g1),
               Graph.Node("w",
                 g1));

h3. Graph with Anonymous types

<pre><code>
  var g = Graph.Node(new { Name="n1", Cost=2.5m },
            Graph.Node(new { Name="n2", Cost=2.5m }),
            Graph.Node(new { Name="n3", Cost=5.31m }));
